**num_leaves**  \r\n   - **max_depth**  \r\n   - **learning_rate**  \r\n   - **feature_fraction**  \r\n   - **bagging_fraction**  \r\n   - **bagging_freq**  \r\n   - **lambda_l1** (L1 regularization)  \r\n   - **lambda_l2** (L2 regularization)  \r\n   - **min_data_in_leaf**  \r\n\r\n2. **Cross-Validation Strategy**:  \r\n   - **K-Fold Cross-Validation** was applied to split the data into multiple training and testing sets.  \r\n   - The **average QWK score** across the folds was used to evaluate model performance.  \r\n\r\n3. **Search Space Limitation**:  \r\n   - Based on references from **Kaggle competitions** and iterative experiments, we adopted a **narrowed search space**.  \r\n   - This ensures efficient exploration while focusing on high-performing parameter ranges.  \r\n## Reason for Trials  \nWe limited the **number of trials to 50** for the following reasons:  \n- **Efficient runtime**: Prevent excessively long computation times.  \n- **Stable performance**: 50 trials provided consistent and optimal results without diminishing returns.  \n\n---\n\n## Result  \n- With the optimized hyperparameters, the model achieved its **best QWK score**.  \n- The **training score** was also reduced, minimizing overfitting and ensuring **better generalization** on unseen data.\n\n### Optimal Hyperparameters  \nAfter 50 trials (sufficient to balance time and performance), the following hyperparameters were identified as optimal:  \n\n{\n    'num_leaves': 484, \n    'max_depth': 11, \n    'learning_rate': 0.04533585929025977, \n    'feature_fraction': 0.8110477902071817, \n    'bagging_fraction': 0.7265461551046623, \n    'bagging_freq': 2, \n    'lambda_l1': 5.338437863405547, \n    'lambda_l2': 4.499492326361118e-06, \n    'min_data_in_leaf': 13\n} data.  \r\n2326361118e-06, \r\n    'min_data_in_leaf': 13\r\n}\r\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import optuna\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nfrom sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef quadratic_weighted_kappa(y_true, y_pred):\n    return cohen_kappa_score(y_true, y_pred, weights='quadratic')\n\n\ndef objective(trial):\n    params = {\n        'objective': 'regression',\n        'metric': 'mae',  \n        'boosting_type': 'gbdt',\n        'num_leaves': trial.suggest_int('num_leaves', 400, 500), \n        'max_depth': trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 10, 15),\n        'learning_rate': trial.suggest_uniform('learning_rate', 0.03, 0.05), \n        'feature_fraction': trial.suggest_uniform('feature_fraction', 0.7, 0.9),  \n        'bagging_fraction': trial.suggest_uniform('bagging_fraction', 0.7, 0.9),  \n        'bagging_freq': trial.suggest_int('bagging_freq', 2, 3),  \n        'lambda_l1': trial.suggest_uniform('lambda_l1', 4, 6), \n        'lambda_l2': trial.suggest_loguniform('lambda_l2', 1e-6, 1e-4),  \n        'min_data_in_leaf': trial.suggest_int('min_data_in_leaf', 10, 15), \n    }\n\n    X = train.drop(['sii'], axis=1)\n    y = train['sii']\n\n    n_splits = 5\n    SKF = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\n    \n    kappa_scores = []\n    \n    for train_idx, val_idx in SKF.split(X, y):\n        X_train, X_val = X.iloc[train_idx], X.iloc[val_idx]\n        y_train, y_val = y.iloc[train_idx], y.iloc[val_idx]\n        \n        model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(**params, random_state=42)\n        model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        \n        y_pred = model.predict(X_val)\n        y_pred_rounded = np.round(y_pred).astype(int)  # Làm tròn dự đoán cho QWK\n        kappa = quadratic_weighted_kappa(y_val, y_pred_rounded)\n        \n        kappa_scores.append(kappa)\n    \n    # Trả về điểm số trung bình của QWK trên các fold\n    return np.mean(kappa_scores)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.851852Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.852202Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.865237Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.852166Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.864527Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"code","source":"study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize')  \nstudy.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)  \n\nprint(\"Best parameters:\", study.best_params)\nprint(\"Best QWK score:\", study.best_value)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.866095Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.866375Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-18T14:34:48.955679Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-18T14:32:00.866348Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-18T14:34:48.954800Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"[I 2024-12-18 14:32:00,875] A new study created in memory with name: no-name-844849d8-b232-4cbd-823e-35801470c26d\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"[LightGBM] [Warning] min_data_in_leaf is set=13, min_child_samples=20 will be ignored.
