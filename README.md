# Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use

Welcome to my **ML Final Project** repository! This repository contains my submissions and solutions for the Kaggle Competitions that we have participated in.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing and addressing **Problematic Internet Use** using machine learning techniques. The dataset and challenges were inspired by the research conducted by the **Child Mind Institute**.

## Repository Contents

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Notebooks for the EDA of tabular and actigraphy data.
- **Hyperparameters Tuning**: Notebook for optimizing, tuning hyperparameters for our model training session.
- **Model Training Pipeline**: Notebook used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. This is the notebook that we used for our submission to the competition.

## Note
The Hyperparameters Tuning notebook takes quite a few minutes to open for the first time, due to its lengthy output, and the github backend. If you cannot open it, you can go to this link: https://nbviewer.org/

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the efforts of the **Child Mind Institute** in addressing mental health challenges related to internet usage.
